I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Bioengineering at Stanford University. I graduated with a M.D and a B.S. in Physics from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Taiwan. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Dar-Bin Shieh](https://researchoutput.ncku.edu.tw/en/persons/dar-bin-shieh) to develop applications of nanoparticle in therapeutics and diagnosis, particularly in the field of infectious diseases. I also worked in a startup company, [RiCHE Biotechnology Inc.](https://www.richebio.com/), as a research engineer to integrate software, hardware, and biology to develop a nanoparticle-based photonic qPCR system for point-of-care (POC) usage.

Prior to my research in nanomedicine, I have participated in the [2016 International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM)](http://2016.igem.org/Team:NCKU_Tainan) using synthetic biology with genetic circuit designs to develop a low-cost urine glucose sensor for diabetes detection and won a gold medal.  

I am also enthusiastic about creating computer programs to solve real-world problems. Driven by my experience in [competitive programming](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/49898) since high school, I've been learning [Deep Neural Network](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/XX8GBLE7JMFB?utm_medium=certificate&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=copybutton_certificate) and [Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/2MJTGC6ZKE46?utm_medium=certificate&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=copybutton_certificate) from Coursera and applied those techniques in medical problems. I also enjoy working with [Prof. Ming-Hao Liu](https://sites.google.com/phys.ncku.edu.tw/minghao-liu/people?authuser=0) to simulate physical phenomenons of electrons on 2D material such as graphene with codes as my side project.
